@Anthropic

â€™s Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus models, now integrated into Box AI, across enterprise Q&A tasks, technical workflows, and advanced coding scenariosâ€”revealing major advancements in developer productivity and content intelligence. AI-assisted coding and development just reached a new milestone!

Here's what we discovered: Claude 4 significantly improves understanding, generating, and debugging code across multiple programming languages. 

Developers can:

â†³ Accelerate code generation

â†³ Improve debugging

â†³ Enhance technical documentation

â†³ Build smarter AI agents

ðŸ‘‰ Automating Financial Analysis with Code Generation: We evaluated Claude 4 by using the Box AI API to analyze ten complex 10-K financial reports. Claude 4 dynamically generated Python code to fetch file IDs from a Box folder, automating data extraction. Within two minutes, it accurately extracted key company data such as revenues, metrics, and highlightsâ€”demonstrating its potential to streamline demanding analytical tasks.

ðŸ‘‰  Understanding Enterprise Content: Our evaluation confirms Claude 4 maintains strong performance on enterprise Q&A tasks, effectively extracting precise details from single documents and reliably synthesizing information across multiple sources. This ensures seamless integration of structured and unstructured data alongside powerful coding capabilities.

ðŸ”“ Developer-Centric Use Cases Unlocked: Organizations can leverage Claude 4 within Box AI to:

â†³ Create custom engineering agents referencing technical documents stored in Box, pulling real-time data from Jira, or finding solutions on Stack Overflow.

â†³ Build intelligent technical support bots capable of analyzing user-provided code snippets against internal manuals.

â†³ Automate secure code reviews by evaluating repository code (stored in Box) against security policies.

â†³ Efficiently migrate legacy systems by translating old codebases into modern languages or platforms.

Keep in mind the following rules when drafting tweets:

<rules>

1. The hook of the tweets should be within the first 280 charactors. DO NOT FORGET THIS.

2. You cannot use hashtags (#). THIS IS OLD, COMPLETELY AVOID THIS.

3. You cannot use emojis (THIS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL)

4. You should leave space in between lines. (TO INCREASE THE READABILITY) 

5. Use bullet points (â†’) if required (THIS WILL INCREASE THE READBILITY)

6. Use short sentences. 

7. Tweets should write in first person from a group i.e. we or us.

8. Tweets should be written to the individual, i.e. you or your 

9. Follow AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):

- Attention: Grab the reader's attention with a compelling headline or opening line.

- Interest: Briefly explain the problem or need that the transcript addresses.

- Desire: Describe how the transcript can solve the problem and fulfill the reader's desires.

- Action: Tell the reader what you want them to do next (e.g., visit your website, get started, etc.). 

10. Words to Avoid:

    Adjectives such as "innovative," "meticulous," "invaluable," and "ingenious." These terms have been flagged for their high frequency in LLM-generated texts and may signal artificial origin.

    Adverbs like "lucidly," "meticulously," "innovatively," and "compellingly." These are also indicative of LLM use and should be used sparingly.

11. Neutral Words to Include:

    Use neutral and common words such as "consider," "conclusion," "furthermore," "relative," and "technical."

    Include basic colors ("blue," "red," "yellow") and temporal terms ("before," "after," "earlier," "later") which are typical and not indicative of LLM origins.

12. General Guidelines:

    Contextual Relevance: Ensure that the vocabulary used is appropriate for the context. Avoid forcing the use of neutral words if they do not fit naturally within the content.

    Natural Language Flow: Strive for a natural flow in writing. Avoid constructions that seem artificial or forced. The goal is to maintain readability and engagement without signaling machine generation.

    Balance and Variety: Maintain a good balance between descriptive language and the use of control words. Do not shy away from descriptive terms entirely, but be mindful of their frequency and the patterns of their use.

    Review and Adjust: Periodically review the text to ensure it aligns with human writing norms. Be open to adjusting phrases to improve the text's naturalness and to ensure it does not reflect typical LLM output patterns.

13. Examples of Adjustment:

    Instead of: "This study presents an innovative and meticulously planned approach."

    Use: "This study presents a well-planned approach and considers several key factors."

    Instead of: "The results are compellingly supported by the data."

    Use: "The data clearly supports the results, as shown in the analysis."

14. Write for search discoverability.

15. Use active voice, not passive.

16. Follow the pattern of write-analyze-rewrite-analyze rewrite. Respond with the third iteration.
