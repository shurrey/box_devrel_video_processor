1. 'Use Box, Box Doc Gen, and the OpenAI Agents SDK + Responses API to build an end-to-end insurance inspection report workflow. This step-by-step demo shows OpenAI's GPT-4.1 mini models classifying claims, analyzing car damage images, estimating repair costs, locating nearby shops, and automatically generating polished reports — with all of the related content stored securely in Box.

Whether you develop enterprise apps, manage insurance processes, or simply want to see agentic workflows in action, this video highlights how quickly you can orchestrate complex tasks with Box’s content platform and OpenAI agentic framework.

Key takeaways:

↳ Orchestrate multi-agent flows using OpenAI Agents SDK and Responses API

↳ Build custom tools for specialized tasks

↳ Enforce structured outputs with Pydantic models and streamline debugging via the Traces dashboard

↳ Auto-generate professional reports with Box Doc Gen

2. 'Discover how the new Snowflake Openflow connector for Box transforms contract management by marrying Box AI with the Snowflake Data Cloud. In this step-by-step demo, you’ll see Box AI extract key contract fields, Snowflake ingest and store that metadata, and custom business logic enrich and push updates back into Box — all within the Snowflake environment. Whether you build data pipelines, manage enterprise content, or simply want to supercharge AI-driven workflows, this session delivers an end-to-end look at streamlined metadata automation.

Key takeaways:

↳ Deploy the Snowflake Openflow runtime and configure Box connector in minutes

↳ Use Box AI to auto-extract dates, parties, and contract flags from PDF agreements

↳ Write extracted metadata to Snowflake tables and combine it with any dataset in Snowsight

↳ Apply custom business rules (e.g., automatic pre-approval for specific vendors) and sync results back to Box

↳ Scale the same pattern for financial services, field service reports, and broader agentic workflows

Keep in mind the following rules when drafting youtube descriptions:

<rules>

1. The hook of the description should be within the first 280 charactors. DO NOT FORGET THIS.

2. You cannot use hashtags (#). THIS IS OLD, COMPLETELY AVOID THIS.

3. You cannot use emojis (THIS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL)

4. You should leave space in between lines. (TO INCREASE THE READABILITY) 

5. Use bullet points (→) if required (THIS WILL INCREASE THE READBILITY)

6. Use short sentences. 

7. Descriptions should write in first person from a group i.e. we or us.

8. Dwscriptions should be written to the individual, i.e. you or your 

9. Follow AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):

- Attention: Grab the reader's attention with a compelling headline or opening line.

- Interest: Briefly explain the problem or need that the transcript addresses.

- Desire: Describe how the transcript can solve the problem and fulfill the reader's desires.

- Action: Tell the reader what you want them to do next (e.g., visit your website, get started, etc.). 

10. 

- Words to Avoid:

    Adjectives such as "innovative," "meticulous," "invaluable," and "ingenious." These terms have been flagged for their high frequency in LLM-generated texts and may signal artificial origin.

    Adverbs like "lucidly," "meticulously," "innovatively," and "compellingly." These are also indicative of LLM use and should be used sparingly.

11. Neutral Words to Include:

    Use neutral and common words such as "consider," "conclusion," "furthermore," "relative," and "technical."

    Include basic colors ("blue," "red," "yellow") and temporal terms ("before," "after," "earlier," "later") which are typical and not indicative of LLM origins.

12. General Guidelines:

    Contextual Relevance: Ensure that the vocabulary used is appropriate for the context. Avoid forcing the use of neutral words if they do not fit naturally within the content.

    Natural Language Flow: Strive for a natural flow in writing. Avoid constructions that seem artificial or forced. The goal is to maintain readability and engagement without signaling machine generation.

    Balance and Variety: Maintain a good balance between descriptive language and the use of control words. Do not shy away from descriptive terms entirely, but be mindful of their frequency and the patterns of their use.

    Review and Adjust: Periodically review the text to ensure it aligns with human writing norms. Be open to adjusting phrases to improve the text's naturalness and to ensure it does not reflect typical LLM output patterns.

13. Examples of Adjustment:

    Instead of: "This study presents an innovative and meticulously planned approach."

    Use: "This study presents a well-planned approach and considers several key factors."

    Instead of: "The results are compellingly supported by the data."

    Use: "The data clearly supports the results, as shown in the analysis."

14. write with search engine optimization in mind. Use key terms and vendors in the first paragraph and periodically throughout.

15. Use active voice, not passive.

16. Follow the pattern of write-analyze-rewrite-analyze rewrite. Respond with the third iteration.
